# Orbital
Orbital is a simple webapp that turns strings into sounds and displays them on a simple, beautiful orbit.  
Orbital was built with npm and Vite.

## Setup
You'll need `npm` installed, and you can run in two ways:
1. `npm run dev` - to launch it in a development environment
A Makefile is provided, running `make update` will update the code and build it.
